/*
The JavaDoc description of java.time.temporal.TemporalAdjusters is very helpful:  
Adjusters are a key tool for modifying temporal objects. 
They exist to externalize the process of adjustment, permitting different approaches, 
as per the strategy design pattern. 

Examples might be an adjuster that sets the date avoiding weekends, 
or one that sets the date to the last day of the month. 

There are two equivalent ways of using a TemporalAdjuster. The first is to invoke the method on the interface directly. 
The second is to use 

Temporal.with(TemporalAdjuster): ���
// these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended ���
temporal = thisAdjuster.adjustInto(temporal); ���
temporal = temporal.with(thisAdjuster);  

It is recommended to use the second approach, with(TemporalAdjuster), as it is a lot clearer to read in code. 
This class contains a standard set of adjusters, available as static methods. 
These include: finding the first or last day of the month finding the first day of next month 
finding the first or last day of the year finding the first day of next year finding the first 
or last day-of-week within a month, such as "first Wednesday in June" finding the next or previous day-of-week, 
such as "next Thursday"
